== Windows Browsers

We don't build ready to use images for Internet Explorer and any other browser under Windows because of Windows license limitations. However we provide detailed instructions on building such images https://github.com/aerokube/windows-images[here]. The same approach can be used for preparing images with Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Opera under Windows.
